/**
 * \brief
 * 	The main application class that provides XWMFS functionality
 * \details
 * 	This is the connector class between the X11 and FUSE related XWMFS
 * 	parts. It keeps the window manager information on the one hand and the
 * 	FUSE file system representation on the other hand.
 *
 * 	This is a singleton class such that it can be accessed globally from
 * 	anyhwere. Any application-global data is kept here.
 *
 * 	This class also runs its own thread that is responsible for dealing
 * 	with events dispatched from Xlib to us. This allows us to update the
 * 	file system structure whenever relevant window manager information
 * 	changes.

	 * 	XInternAtom from other threads then neither the separte Event
	 * 	thread nor the thread calling XInternAtom will unblock as long

	 * 	This is a FIXME in libX11 source file xcb_io.c in function
	 * 	_XReply() we're running into here. This lock here is supposed
	 * 	to prevent entering this situation by only calling into
	 * 	XNextEvent() when no other threads are actually doing
	 * 	asynchronous X calls.
	 *
	 * 	This currently mostly happens in the "properties" node where
	 * 	custom atom names are handling in the context of a FUSE
