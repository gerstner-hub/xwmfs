	version 0.81

	Bugfix release

	- fixed an issue in the X11 event handling that caused property events
	to also be erronously processed as geometry update events. this could
	cause invalid content of the "geometry" file for windows.
	- fixed distribution tarball (make dist)

2017-10-15 Matthias Gerstner <Matthias.Gerstner@nefkom.net>

	version 0.8

	First full featured release that can be considered for production use:

	- added some example scripts in the examples folder that show what can
	be done with the file system
	- fixed a bug that could cause events not to show up immediately but
	only after some unrelated events occured in the X server.
	- added man page for the main xwmfs binary
	- added parent/child relationship to the file system
	- added --handle-pseudo-windows parameter to include hidden and
	special windows in the file system
	- added 'events' node to the 'wm' directory to allow waiting for
	window manager wide events
	- added 'properties' node for each window containing all window
	properties and allows for adding, removing and changing arbitrary
	window properties
	- added window 'class' file node
	- renamed 'command' file node to 'control', because 'command' already
	has a meaning
	- added 'locale' file node for each window
	- added 'protocols' file node for each window
	- added 'window_type' and 'client_leader' file nodes
	- added 'geometry' node for each window which can also be used for
	changing size and location of windows
	- added 'selections' top level directory that allows interaction with
	the X server selection buffers very much like what the 'xsel' tool can
	do
