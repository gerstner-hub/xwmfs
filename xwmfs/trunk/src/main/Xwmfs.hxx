/**
 * \brief
 * 	The main application class that provides XWMFS functionality
 * \details
 * 	This is the connector class between the X11 and FUSE related XWMFS
 * 	parts. It keeps the window manager information on the one hand and the
 * 	FUSE file system representation on the other hand.
 *
 * 	This is a singleton class such that it can be accessed globally from
 * 	anyhwere. Any application-global data is kept here.
 *
 * 	This class also runs its own thread that is responsible for dealing
 * 	with events dispatched from Xlib to us. This allows us to update the
 * 	file system structure whenever relevant window manager information
 * 	changes.
