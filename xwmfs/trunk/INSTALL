xwmfs uses autotools as a buildsystem. The following commands will build and
install everything with default settings:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install

For successful compilation the following dependencies are required:

- the x11 client library
- the fuse (file system in userspace) library

For running the file system the fuse kernel module (CONFIG_FUSE_FS) also needs
to be available.

Only Linux on x86-64 has been tested by me so far.

There are currently no special configure options available for xwmfs besides
the default options provided by autotools.
